An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is a XOR ofthe next node and the previous node. Implement a XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.<br/>
If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to 'get_pointer' and 'dereference_pointer' functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
